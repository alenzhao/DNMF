# DNMF
Discriminant Non-Negative Matrix Factorization

This package has been submitted to CRAN(http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DNMF).

Discriminant Non-Negative Matrix Factorization is to extend the Non-negative Matrix Factorization algorithm in order to extract features that enforce not only the spatial locality, but also the separability between classes in a discriminant manner.
